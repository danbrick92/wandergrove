Installation:
	If on Windows, install items in bin
    1) osgeo4w-setup installs GDAL for Windows
        Installation
            Just run the setup
            Then add this to your path: C:\OSGeo4W\bin
        **NOTE THE MSYS INSTALL BELOW MIGHT MAKE THIS NOT NEEDED**

    2) msys-x86_64 allows Go to compile 64 bit installation
        Installation - run installer, then run these two commands in MSYS2:
            pacman -Syu
            pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain
            Then add this to your PATH: C:\msys64\mingw64\bin
            Then set go to use the new compiler: set CC=x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc

            If you are having issues compiling due to gdal.h:
                set CGO_CFLAGS=-IC:\msys64\mingw64\include
                set CGO_LDFLAGS=-LC:\msys64\mingw64\lib
                youou can run in MSYS32: pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gdal
                Check the C:\OSGeo4W64\bin path to make sure headers are there
